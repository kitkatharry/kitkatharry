## Yooo! Welcome to my GitHub!

I don't really code much but when I do it will probably be when im coding in either **Python, HTML, CSS, JS or Batch**.

Intrests:
Aviation,
Linux **(even though it hates me)**,
F1 **(Formula 1)**,
Networking,
Running/Testing out Malware and Ransomware **(aswell as looking at the files)** and
Listening to music :)
